            Welcome To How is the Weather!

        <p id="description" class="secondary">
            How's the Weather is one of the globaly celebrated weather forecast agencies. Our Agency has been working
            with the weather
            forecast since the last 2 decades and has reported about several calamities in the past.
            We intend to do so in the coming future. In the website you can see the weather report of any area
            around the world in three different ways.
            The first way is to directly enter the city name, the second one is throgh Maps.You basically choose the
            location to get the weather report of the city. The third one is through entering the city ID of the
            city. Now, that's a lot of jibber-jabber.. We can get to work now..
